Produces the thermodynamic properties of air species for use in hypersonic flow simulations

monatoms and diatoms contain files to produce these properties across a temperature range
The work of Mario Capitelli (1970-2014) largely underpins this analysis

these properties can then be fit using polynomials for direct integration into Eilmer4

the eilmer4 documentation and repository can be found at the following URL.
http://cfcfd.mechmining.uq.edu.au/eilmer/

the Eilmer4 scripts used to validate these models appear in the Eilmer4 folder
this has been prepared for use in running jobs on the university of queensland tinaroo hpc cluster,
however it may be run on any machine with an installation of Eilmer4


some supplementary data drawn from the tables of Capitelli 2005 is provided to save someone
else from having to repeat this process. They appear for a dE of 250cm^-1.
